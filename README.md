# CodeCad_Ex_9_Colmar_Capstone

Capstone project assignment website for my CodeCademy 'Web Developer Ready' course.
Developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Flexbox.
We were given images and a brief we had to emulate, the specification .png is available in the files for this repository.
(A design driven assignment - elements on page adjust to the user's screen size, buttons move user to a another page segment, 
some links are for purely aesthetic purposes and provide no functionality)
